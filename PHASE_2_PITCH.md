# CleanCity Phase 2 Pitch: From Reporting to Action

## The Vision: Evolving from a Tool to a Movement

Phase 1 of CleanCity successfully established our core foundation: a platform for citizens to report waste, engage with awareness content, and connect with their community's environmental goals. We've built the essential tool for *seeing* the problem.

For Phase 2, our vision is to evolve CleanCity from a reporting tool into a proactive, community-driven movement. We want to empower our users to not just report problems, but to actively *solve* them.

## Key Features for Phase 2

We will achieve this through three key features:

1.  **Gamification and Rewards:**
    - Introduce a points system where users earn rewards and badges for reporting issues, sharing content, and—most importantly—participating in cleanups.
    - A city-wide leaderboard will foster friendly competition and dramatically boost engagement.

2.  **Community Events Module:**
    - Empower users to become local leaders by creating, organizing, and scheduling their own cleanup events.
    - Other users can RSVP, coordinate in-app, and share before-and-after photos, turning individual reports into collective, visible impact.

3.  **Impact Dashboard with a Live Heatmap:**
    - Use our collected data to publicly visualize problem hotspots.
    - Track the progress of cleanup events in real-time and showcase the tangible difference our community is making.
    - This provides invaluable data for city planners and motivates everyone involved.

## The Impact: Building a Cleaner, Engaged Community

In short, Phase 2 moves us from passive reporting to active participation. It incentivizes action, empowers local leaders, and provides clear, data-driven proof of our collective success.

It transforms CleanCity into a self-sustaining engine for a cleaner, more engaged community.
